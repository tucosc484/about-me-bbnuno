## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?

  - I worked with an app development company but I was responsible for research and data entry -- not so much responsible for code or design. 
  - As for the major, I had always been interested in computers and with technology. I figured I might as well start in college. 
  - It's an interesting topic, and one I would like to eventually be well versed in.
 
## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
 - If I don't retire to Spain after having opened and managed a business in Barcelona or Madrid, then I know I will not have done things correctly.
 
## What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
 - During summer breaks, I normally instruct small classes of kids between 12-17 and introduce them to the basics of programming. 
 - I do not have much web experience
